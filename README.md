This is a project that attempts to segment MRIs using various clustering algorithms and compare their efficacy. 
Using the segmented tissues, a 3D model of the patient's braini is contstructed for improved visualization.

Use data.py to pre-process the MRIs

Then either Segment.py or Cluster3D.py to perform the clustering based off of your intended use case.

You can visualize using viz.py or construct3D.py.
